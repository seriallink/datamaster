// Package misc provides utility constants and helper functions used across the Data Master project.
//
// It includes reusable logic for common tasks such as string checks, ternary operations,
// ANSI color formatting, and global layer identifiers (e.g., raw, bronze, silver, gold).
//
// This package serves as a lightweight support layer for both CLI tools and processing components,
// helping to reduce code duplication and centralize generic behavior.
